Thankfully, my parents encouraged me to pursue my bachelor's degree in Zoology. While at university, I took exciting opportunities to work with plants, mice, shrews, frogs, flying squirrels, fruit flies, bats, and beavers! After finishing my undergraduate degree in 2018, I immediately began my dissertation on the determinants of social bonding in common vampire bats. For six years, this work was the source of many adventures and incredible experiences. In 2024, I received my PhD and started an exciting position in graphic design, data visualization, and science interpretation at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior.
