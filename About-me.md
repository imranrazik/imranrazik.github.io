My parents, unable to obtain a higher education, therefore encouraged me to pursue my bachelor's degree in Zoology. While at university, I took exciting opportunities to work with plants, mice, shrews, frogs, flying squirrels, fruit flies, bats, and beavers! After graduating in 2018, I then moved to Ohio to begin my doctoral dissertation on the development and regulation of cooperative relationships in vampire bats.

As for more personal interests of mine, I really love listening to and talking about music, and recently I've been getting into digital illustration!
