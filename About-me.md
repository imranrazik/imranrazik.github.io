# About me
---

I really love listening to and talking about music (**if anyone wants to share spotify playlists let me know**). I'm also a huge fan of nature walks and driving with the windows down. My favorite color is a tie between blue and green. My favorite food is Life Cinnamon Cereal. I named my goldfish Ralph Macchio.
