Neither of my parents were able to obtain college degrees, so they encouraged me to pursue my greatest interests. For me, this meant pursuing a degree in Zoology. While at university, I took exciting opportunities to work with plants, mice, shrews, frogs, flying squirrels, fruit flies, bats, and beavers! After graduating with my bachelor's in 2018, I moved to Ohio to begin my doctoral dissertation on the development and regulation of cooperative relationships in vampire bats.

As for more personal interests of mine, I really love listening to and talking about music, and recently I've been getting into digital illustration. I also love to explore new places!
