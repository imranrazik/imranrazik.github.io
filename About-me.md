I knew from a young age that I loved to observe and learn about animals. My parents didn't receive a college education, so they encouraged me to pursue my bachelor's degree in Zoology. While at university, I took exciting opportunities to work with plants, mice, shrews, frogs, flying squirrels, fruit flies, bats, and beavers! After graduating in 2018, I then moved to Ohio to begin my dissertation on the development and regulation of cooperative relationships in vampire bats.

As for more personal interests of mine, I really love listening to and talking about music, and recently I've been getting into digital illustration!
