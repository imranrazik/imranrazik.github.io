<b> Hi! I’m a zoologist, designer, data scientist, and outreach specialist at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Konstanz, Germany. </b> <br/>

After 10 years of research experience in the field of animal behavior, I developed a deep passion for science communication, interpretation, and education. These days, I have lots of fun designing, writing, and delivering content that connects with audiences of all ages and backgrounds.

Feel free to reach out if you’re interested in collaborating or would like to know more about my work :)
