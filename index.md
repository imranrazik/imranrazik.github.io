##### Hi!
<b> I'm a behavioral ecologist interested in social relationships, cognition, and individual variation. </b> <br/>
I'm also a PhD student and member of the Carter Lab at Ohio State University in Columbus, OH, USA.
 
For my dissertation, I work with common vampire bats to answer three **primary research questions**: <br/>
1. *How do we quantify among-individual variation in cooperative traits that are dependent on dyadic interactions and the market of available partners?*
2. *Which factors (such as age, association, or cooperativeness) are most important for predicting the development of new social relationships in vampire bats?* 
3. *Can we control partner choice in vampire bats by experimentally manipulating opportunities to cooperate?*

For more info on what the bats and I might be up to, check for updates [here](https://imranrazik.github.io/Blog.html)~ <br/>
Please reach out if you have any questions or want to hear more!
