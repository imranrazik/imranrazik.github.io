### Hi!
<b> I'm a behavioral ecologist that studies social relationships, cooperation, and individual variation. </b> <br/>

I'm also a PhD candidate and member of the [Carter Lab](https://socialbat.org/) at Ohio State University in Columbus, OH, USA.
 
For my dissertation, I work with common vampire bats to answer a few **primary research questions**: <br/>
1. *How and why do individuals vary in their propensity to cooperate with strangers?*
2. *Does short-term proximity facilitate the development of long-lasting cooperative relationships?* 
3. *Can we control partner choice by experimentally manipulating opportunities to cooperate?*

For more info on what the bats and I might be up to, check for updates [here](https://imranrazik.github.io/Blog.html). <br/>

Please reach out if you have any questions or want to hear more~
