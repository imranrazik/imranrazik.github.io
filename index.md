<b> Hi! I’m a behavioral ecologist, graphic designer, and outreach specialist at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Konstanz, Germany. </b> <br/>

I have close to 10 years of research experience in animal behavior, during which time I developed a deep passion for science interpretation and education. I have lots of fun designing and/or writing content that connects with audiences of all ages and backgrounds, including stickers, t-shirts, presentations, flyers, and much more! 

Feel free to reach out if you’re interested in collaborating or would like to know more about my work :)
