### Hi!
<b> I’m a behavioral ecologist and PhD candidate in the [Carter Lab](https://socialbat.org/) at The Ohio State University. </b> <br/>
 
For my dissertation, I work with common vampire bats at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute to answer exciting questions related to social bonding, cooperation, and individual variation. My primary research questions are as follows:<br/>

1. *How does proximity contribute to the development of enduring social preferences?*<br/>

2. *How does acute infection limit social integration in new social environments?*<br/>

3. *How and why do individuals differ in their propensity to cooperate with strangers?*<br/>

4. *How well can we predict cooperative outcomes given actor and receiver identity?*<br/>

Feel free to reach out if you’re curious to know more about my research progress! You can also find my most recent publications [here](https://imranrazik.github.io/CV.html). <br/>
