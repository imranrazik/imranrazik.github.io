### Hi!
<b> I’m a behavioral ecologist and PhD candidate in the [Carter Lab](https://socialbat.org/) at The Ohio State University. </b> <br/>
 
For my dissertation, I work with common vampire bats at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama to answer exciting questions related to social bonding, cooperation, and individual variation. My primary research questions are:<br/>

1. *How does proximity contribute to the development of enduring social preferences?*<br/>

2. *How does acute infection limit social integration in new social environments?*<br/>

3. *How do individuals differ in their propensity to cooperate with strangers?*<br/>

4. *How well can we predict the outcome of a cooperative relationship?*<br/>

I also have a deep passion for science interpretation and education, through which I often connect with diverse audiences from around the world. I have lots of fun designing and/or writing different outreach materials, including stickers, shirts, presentations, flyers, and more! 

Feel free to reach out if you’re curious to know more about my work :)
