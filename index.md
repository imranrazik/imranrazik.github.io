##### Hello! I'm a behavioral ecologist interested in social relationships, cognition, and individual variation.
#### I'm also a PhD student and member of the Carter Lab at The Ohio State University in Columbus, OH, USA.
 
For my dissertation, I work with common vampire bats to answer three **primary research questions**: <br/>
1. *How do we quantify among-individual variation in cooperative traits that are inherently dependent on dyadic interactions and the market of available partners?*
2. *Which factors (such as age, association, or cooperativeness) are most important for predicting the development of new social relationships in vampire bats?* 
3. *Can we control partner choice in vampire bats by experimentally manipulating opportunities to cooperate?*
